## Edwards-Wilkinson equation
The **Edwards–Wilkinson (EW) equation** is a linear stochastic partial differential equation (PDE) used to describe surface growth and smoothing. In its deterministic form (i.e., without noise), it is equivalent to the heat (diffusion) equation. This equation models the smoothing (or diffusion) of the height profile over time.
